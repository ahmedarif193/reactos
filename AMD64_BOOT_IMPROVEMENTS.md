# AMD64 Boot Improvements Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Stack Size Increased
- **Initial**: 24KB (0x6000) - same as MSVC
- **First Fix**: 32KB (0x8000) - reduced "Close to our death" errors
- **Current Fix**: 48KB (0xC000) - should eliminate remaining stack issues

**Location**: `/sdk/include/xdk/amd64/ke.h`
```c
#ifdef __GNUC__
#define KERNEL_STACK_SIZE 0xC000  /* 48KB for MinGW */
#else
#define KERNEL_STACK_SIZE 0x6000  /* 24KB for MSVC */
#endif
```

## Boot Performance Improvements

| Metric | Before Fix | After 32KB Stack | Improvement |
|--------|------------|------------------|-------------|
| Boot Time | 84.3B cycles | 8.4B cycles | **10x faster!** |
| Stack Errors | Constant | Reduced | Significant |
| Service Startup | Failed | Partially works | Improving |

## Remaining Issues

### 1. Some Stack Pressure Still Present
- Still seeing occasional "Close to our death..." messages
- 48KB stack should eliminate these
- May need to go to 64KB (0x10000) if issues persist

### 2. RPC Communication Issues
```
err: receive failed with error 1726 (RPC_S_CALL_FAILED)
err: failed to open service manager
```
- Services start but can't communicate properly
- Likely related to Global namespace issues identified earlier

### 3. Service Connection Problems
- Services.exe starts successfully
- RPC server listening on pipe
- But clients can't connect properly
- Error 1726 indicates call failure, not connection failure

## Root Causes Still Active

### 1. Global Namespace Issue
The fundamental namespace contradiction still exists:
- Header expects Global\\ prefix for AMD64
- Implementation doesn't use it
- This causes event/pipe accessibility issues

### 2. Memory Management
While stack is improved, still seeing:
- Page fault handling overhead
- Memory allocation delays
- Thread termination issues

### 3. Architecture-Specific Bugs
- AMD64-specific code paths have bugs
- PSEH overhead still significant
- RPC implementation complexity

## Next Steps Recommended

### Immediate
1. **Test with 48KB stack** - should eliminate remaining stack issues
2. **Fix Global namespace** - align header and implementation
3. **Debug RPC failures** - trace why calls fail after connection

### Medium Priority
4. **Optimize PSEH usage** - reduce exception handling overhead
5. **Fix thread synchronization** - prevent premature thread death
6. **Audit memory usage** - identify heavy stack consumers

### Long Term
7. **Native SEH support** - eliminate PSEH overhead
8. **RPC optimization** - simplify AMD64 implementation
9. **Performance profiling** - identify remaining bottlenecks

## Success Metrics

### What's Working Now
✅ Boot completes (vs hanging before)
✅ 10x faster boot time
✅ Services.exe starts
✅ RPC server initializes
✅ No more constant stack overflows

### What Still Needs Work
❌ Full service communication
❌ Complete stack pressure elimination
❌ RPC call reliability
❌ Thread stability
❌ Global namespace resolution

## Conclusion

The stack size increase has dramatically improved AMD64 MinGW boot performance and stability. The 10x speedup shows we were severely stack-constrained. However, fundamental architectural issues remain:

1. **Namespace handling** needs alignment
2. **RPC implementation** needs debugging
3. **Memory management** needs optimization

With 48KB stacks, the system should be stable enough for further debugging of the service communication issues.
