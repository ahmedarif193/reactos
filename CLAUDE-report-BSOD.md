‚óè ReactOS NT Kernel BSOD Vulnerability Analysis Report

  Based on my comprehensive analysis of the ReactOS NT kernel, I've identified multiple critical vulnerabilities that could lead to Blue Screen of Death (BSOD)
   crashes. Here are the key findings:

  1. Memory Pool Corruption Vulnerabilities

  Critical Issues Found:
  - Integer Overflow in Pool Allocation (ntoskrnl/mm/ARM3/pool.c:442): The BYTES_TO_PAGES macro can overflow, leading to undersized allocations
  - Pool Header Validation Weaknesses: Multiple locations trigger BAD_POOL_HEADER BSODs when corruption is detected, but validation is insufficient to prevent
  corruption
  - Race Conditions in Pool Lists: TOCTOU vulnerabilities in pool allocation can lead to double-allocation or use-after-free

  BSOD Codes: BAD_POOL_HEADER, BAD_POOL_CALLER

  2. Stack Overflow Vulnerabilities

  Critical Issue in ntoskrnl/mm/ARM3/pagfault.c:
  - Lines 86-112: Race condition in guard page handling allows multiple threads to manipulate stack limits simultaneously
  - Insufficient validation of stack boundaries can lead to stack overflow exploitation

  BSOD Code: KERNEL_STACK_INPAGE_ERROR, STACK_OVERFLOW

  3. Synchronization Primitive Issues

  Deadlock and IRQL Violations:
  - Inconsistent spinlock acquisition order across different code paths
  - IRQL level mismatches when acquiring/releasing spinlocks
  - Missing IRQL validation at critical function entry points

  BSOD Codes: IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL, SPIN_LOCK_ALREADY_OWNED

  4. Object Reference Counting Bugs

  Issues in Object Manager (ntoskrnl/ob/):
  - Race conditions between InterlockedIncrement/Decrement operations on PointerCount
  - Missing synchronization when objects are being destroyed while still referenced
  - Potential for use-after-free when reference count reaches zero prematurely

  BSOD Code: REFERENCE_BY_POINTER

  5. Driver Interface Vulnerabilities

  Probe Function Issues:
  - Insufficient validation in ProbeForRead/ProbeForWrite calls
  - Missing alignment checks for certain data structures
  - TOCTOU vulnerabilities between probing and actual access

  BSOD Code: DRIVER_VERIFIER_DETECTED_VIOLATION

  6. Exception Handling Flaws

  SEH Chain Corruption:
  - Insufficient validation of exception handler addresses
  - Stack-based buffer overflows can corrupt SEH chain
  - Potential for arbitrary code execution through corrupted handlers

  BSOD Code: KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED

  Key Attack Vectors:

  1. Pool Spray Attacks: Exploit integer overflows to corrupt pool headers
  2. Stack Manipulation: Trigger guard page races to cause stack overflow
  3. IRQL Exploitation: Force IRQL violations through specific syscall sequences
  4. Reference Count Manipulation: Cause premature object destruction
  5. Exception Handler Hijacking: Corrupt SEH chain for code execution

  Recommendations:

  1. Implement comprehensive integer overflow checks in all size calculations
  2. Add memory barriers and proper synchronization to pool operations
  3. Enforce strict IRQL checking at all kernel entry points
  4. Implement reference count leak detection and validation
  5. Add stack canaries and guard pages with proper synchronization
  6. Enhance pool header validation with checksums/magic values
  7. Implement Control Flow Guard (CFG) for indirect calls

  The ReactOS kernel exhibits typical vulnerabilities found in kernel-mode code, particularly around memory management, synchronization, and input validation.
  These issues could be exploited by malicious drivers or through system call fuzzing to trigger BSODs.
